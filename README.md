### About Me

I’m an undergraduate student majoring in Cyberspace Security at Shandong University and a member of Tsinghua University's VUL337 lab. My primary research focuses on **IoT security**, particularly within `Linux` and `RTOS` environments. Additionally, I’m a dedicated `PWN` player for both `HASHTEAM` and `NEPNEP`, contributing to and organizing numerous CTF competitions.

### Vulnerability Discovery Results💥

I have discovered multiple vulnerabilities, each receiving official CVE recognition:

- **CVE-2024-45880 (Motorola)**
  A command injection vulnerability exists in Motorola CX2L router v1.0.2 and below. The vulnerability stems from the SetStationSettings function, which directly calls the system function to execute commands for parameters like MAC addresses without proper input validation. This allows malicious actors to inject and execute arbitrary commands.
  - CVSS 3.x Base Score: 8.0 (HIGH)
- **CVE-2024-45881 to 45893 & 43027 (DrayTek)**
  CVE-2024-43027 as a case：It affects DrayTek Vigor 3900 (before v1.5.1.5_Beta), Vigor 2960 (before v1.5.1.5_Beta), and Vigor 300B (before v1.5.1.5_Beta), where a command injection vulnerability was found in the action parameter of the `cgi-bin/mainfunction.cgi`.
  - CVSS 3.x Base Score: 8.0 (HIGH)

In addition, I am in the process of submitting multiple TP-LINK 0day vulnerabilities.

### Competition Awards🏆

Throughout my academic journey, I’ve participated in various prestigious competitions, achieving several accolades:

- **2nd Prize, 7th Blue Hat Cup National College Student Cybersecurity Competition**
- **2nd Prize, 2023 Shandong Provincial Information Security Competition**
- 3rd Prize, 17th National College Student Information Security Competition
- 3rd Prize, Jingqi CTF National Competition
- **Ranked 9th/40 in the 2023 Xiangshan Cup finals as a solo participant against three-member teams🥷**
